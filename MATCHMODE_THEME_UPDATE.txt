I'll update MatchMode to use the light theme matching the rest of the PlayPal website.

Key changes needed:
1. Background: from dark gradient to bg-background (light)
2. Text colors: from #F5F5DC to foreground/muted-foreground
3. Card backgrounds: from gray-800 to bg-card with border
4. Button styles: use standard variant styles
5. Add pt-20 pb-12 to main for navbar spacing

This will make MatchMode consistent with Dashboard, Venues, and other pages.
